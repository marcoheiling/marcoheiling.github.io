        <h2>Educational Background</h2>
        <p>I went for 4 years to primary school, 4 years to middle school and then I for five years to the HTBLA
            Kaindorf, with the focus on Informatic.</p>
        <p>There I learned a lot about all kind of different IT sections. Although
            working
            with
            cables and parts can be very interesting, I discovered that I am more into the Software side of things. The
            school
            provides the students with a variety of options to get certificates in different subjects if they choose to.
        </p><br>
        I gladly took on most of the opportunities and got the following ones:

        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">Cisco CCNA Certificate (Networking)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Cisco CCNR Certificate (Cyber Security)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Oracle OCA (Java and Object-Oriented Programming)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Cambridge Certificate (English)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">SAP Basics Certificate (SAP)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>I very much enjoyed my time there and that reflected on my notes. I graduated there in 2018 with a grade
            average
            of
            1,7. </p>

        After that I began studying Business Software Development at the FH Campus 02 in Graz. This field of study
        contains
        a mixture of economics and technical lectures. It is designed as being Dual, which means after the first two
        semesters there is a split where you study two days and work three days a week. I like this form of
        incorporating
        practice so you can already put the things learned in use.
        I am currently in the third semester and had even managed to get a scholarship because of my good grades.

        <h2>Work experience</h2>
        <p>After graduating in the HTBLA Kaindorf I had the chance to work at the Knapp IT Solutions for half a year
            before
            I
            had to do my military service. There I started working as a junior SAP EWM Developer. That means working
            with
            huge
            warehouses and develop software to ensure that the goods in there went safely from A to B. Even though it
            was
            only a
            short amount of time there, I learned very much which I still use to this day. For example, the importance
            of
            good
            documentary and the use of organizational software.</p>
        <p>Then the time came for the basic military service in Austria. Fortunately, instead of crawling in the mud, I
            got
            the
            chance to be there as a cyber soldier. As this what I had to do was fixing technical problems, introduce new
            IT
            systems and software and even held presentations about IT to the military commander of styria.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the summer of 2020, after completing the first two semesters of studying, I again started working for the
            Knapp
            IT Solutions besides studying.

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>One of my greatest skill I have is that I am a quick learner. Especially when working with technology, I can
            pick up
            things quite easily. IT is my hobby and I like to be good at what I do there, so I try my best to improve my
            skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also am very curious and like to try out new things. I have stepped foot in almost all parts of it and
            like to
            expand my horizon from day to day. From machine learning to programming a raspberry pi, I did everything.

        </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, as I did more and more programming, I also managed my problem-solving skill a lot. This is a
            crucial
            skill to have in software development because you will be confronted with problems and bugs almost every
            day.

                <h3>JoinMe</h3>
                <p> part of my diploma thesis as part of graduation from the HTBLA Kaindorf I and three of my friends
                    worked
                    on a
                    Web-Application with the newest technology (at the time). JoinMe is a car-sharing service with the
                    focus on
                    rural
                    areas and relatively short routes in comparison to other apps.
                    This has been a collaboration with the city of Leibnitz and the state of Styria.
                    Unfortunately, the app has been discontinued because none of us had the time to do so.</p>

                <h3>Game Development</h3>
                <p>I always liked playing video games and as a child dreamed of one day making games myself. I have not
                    managed
                    to
                    release a completed game yet, but I am on a good way there. Making video games by yourself is quite
                    the
                    challenge
                    because there is so much to do like: programming, designing, music, storytelling and so on. Game
                    development
                    is
                    not
                    my number one priority, but I like to publish at least a small game in the next year or two.</p>

                <p>Roughly translated to “What are we having to eat?”, this website I build for my girlfriend and me is

                    to be
                    some sort of online recipe book. I am not that proficient into web-development so this is a good
                    practice
                    for
                    me.

                <p>As I am not only developing software for work, but for fun in my free time too, I did a lot of
